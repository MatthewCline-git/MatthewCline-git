# Howdy pard'ner 🤠

I'm Matt. I like writing code that removes friction between me/my friends and the things we like to do. Here is what I've been up to lately.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🤖 Higher Pleasures Bot

_Python • TypeScript • Prompt Engineering • Telegram • Google Sheets_

Backend:

A Telegram bot that leverages LLMs to intelligently categorize activities. Message the bot how you spent your time in plain English, and it will call OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API with a carefully engineered prompt to extract duration and activity information from your message and log it in Google Sheets. A friend and I are using it to track our time management in 2025 in an effort to substitute creativity for doomscrolling.

Frontend:

A Typescript frontend to display user stats/trends. This one is very much
a work in progress to sharpen my frontend development skills. I'll get there
soon enough.

### 🚇 NYC Subway Times API

_Python • FastAPI • GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)_

A REST API providing real-time NYC subway arrival data and route information. Features smart station name matching, a custom exception hierarchy, and Docker deployment support. I feed this to a display in my apartment so I can see when the next train is at my stop
without having to pull out my phone.

### 🎟️ Resy Reservation Assistant

_Rust • API Reverse Engineering • Async Programming_

I just wanted to take my girlfriend to a nice dinner at a reasonable hour. I built this tool to monitor and book restaurant reservations right when they drop. Doing this required reverse engineering Resy's API endpoints from the frontend, which was just too much fun. However, I've decommed this tool as a moral matter. Please enjoy it in its current, defanged state.
